# <Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This webpage was created as a place where new students enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp can keep all their pre-work notes organized and all in one place. This will help students access prework notes as needed or add to them as they learn new skills. I built this project to help ease the frustration and anxiety that some students might face when starting the coding bootcamp. Having all your notes seperated by topic and organized efficiently will provide structure for new students and help them feel more confident for the first day of class.

## Usage

Each section in the webpage contain notes about a certain topic, such as HTML, CSS, Git, or JavaScript. If you open the ChromeDev tools (right-click "inspect" or Command+Option+I) we can see the JavaScript running. A console panel will appear on the screen and list the topics we learned from the pre-work modules and choose one topic, at random, for us to study first.
