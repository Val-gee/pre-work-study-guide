          <li>"style" element attributes to the color of a single heading.</li>
          <li>"link" element is used when you have an external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline, Internal, and External CSS sheet style.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding property adds space around th econtent inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements on a page, you use a wild symbol. Such as *.</li>
          <li>Practice the DRY (do not repeat) code by combining selectors with commas.</li>
          <li>The text.align element is used as a positioning property as a way to center a title.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The "script" element links the JavaScript file to the HTML file, just like the "link" element in CSS. </li>
          <li>A variable (var) is a container that store values. You start by using the "let" element followed by "myVariable".</li>
          <li>Variables are case sensitive. You can also creat and add a name to the variable in the same line.</li>
          <li>Comments are just snipets of text that don't trigger a responser from the browser. Use wild symbols, such as *, the block in text that will only by for human readers.</li>
          <li>Strict equality (===) runs tests to see if two values are equal. (I.e. letmyVariable =3; myVariable=4;) The results come back in the form of a ture/false statement.</li>
          <li>A function is a way of packing functionality that you wish to reuse. </li>
          <li>Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. Console refers to a test environment and log() refers to a set of instructions that can be exectuted by the computer.</li>
